  For a first demonstration ABM use case, we begin with an example of a Swift/T
  parallel parameter sweep to explore the parameter space of a model.
  This tutorial uses the project structure and files created from the
  EMEWS <modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/templating.html"
  ref="sweep_section"><tt id="mycode">sweep</tt></modal-data> template, and that should
  be read before this.

</p>
Tutorial goals:
<p>
  <ul>
    <li> Run an ABM simulation using Repast in Swift/T</li>
    <li> Execute parallel parameters sweep of ABM simulation model </li>
    <li> Implement parallel evaluation of the simulation results using Swift/T and R</li>
  </uL>
</p>

<h2 id="jzombies">JZombie: Repast simulation </h2>

<p>The example model used here is an adaptation of the JZombies demonstration model distributed with Repast Simphony
  (<modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/refs/rj_getting_started.html">Nick Collier and Michael North 2015</modal-data>). This is only an example model. Any simulation
  or scientific application that can be
  launched from the command line can be adapted to this paradigm. The fictional Zombies
  versus Humans model is intended to illustrate that Swift/T and Repast Simphony are domain agnostic.
</p>

  <h3> Model details </h3>

  <p>
    The model has two kinds of agents, Zombies and Humans. Zombies chase the Humans,
    seeking to infect them, while Humans attempt to evade Zombies. When a
    Zombie is close enough to a Human, that Human is infected and becomes a
    Zombie. During a typical run all the Humans will eventually become Zombies.
    These agents are located in a two dimensional continuous
    space where each agent has a x and y coordinate expressed as a floating point number
    (and in a corresponding discrete grid with integer coordinates).
    Movement is performed in the continuous space and translated into discrete grid coordinates.
      The grid is used for neighborhood queries (e.g., given a Zombieâ€™s location, where are the nearest Humans).
      The model records the grid coordinate of each agent as well as a count of each agent type (Zombie or Human)
      at each time step and writes this data to two files.
      The initial number of Zombies and Humans is specified
        by model input parameters zombie count and human count, and the distance a Zombie or Human can move at each
        time step is specified by the parameters zombie step size and human step size.</p>

        <h2> Calling a Repast Simphony simulation from Swift/T</h2>

        <p> The full Swift/T script can be seen in <open-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift">swiftrun.swift</open-code>.
          The scripts consists of three functions, one that calls the simulation
          (lines <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="7" to="10">8-11</highlight-code>)
          and two utility functions (lines <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift"
          color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="12" to="14">13-15</highlight-code> and
          <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift"
         color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="16" to="18">17-19</highlight-code> respectively), followed
         by the code that performs the sweep (lines
         <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift"
        color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="20" to="32">21-33</highlight-code>).

        <p>
          In order for Swift/T to call our external application (i.e., the Zombies model),
          we define an
          <modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/swiftt.html" ref="external_execution">app</modal-data> function.
          (The Zombies model is written in Java which is not easily called via Tcl and thus an app function is the best
          choice for integrating the model into a Swift script. See the Swift/T Tutorial for more details.) Repast Simphony provides command line compatible functionality
          via an InstanceRunner class, for passing a set of parameters to a model and performing a single headless
          run of the model using those parameters. Using the InstanceRunner main class, Repast Simphony models can be launched by other
          control applications such as a bash, PBS, or Swift scripts.  We have wrapped the command line invocation of
          Repast Simphony's InstanceRunner in a bash script
          <open-code code="uc1/scripts/repast.sh">repast.sh</open-code> to ease command line usage. Other
          non-Repast Simphony models or scientific applications with command line interfaces can be wrapped
          and run similarly.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Swift app function that calls Repast Simphony is shown in
          <open-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift">swiftrun.swift</open-code>.
          Prior to the actual function definition, the environment variable
          EMEWS_PROJECT_ROOT is accessed. This variable is used to define the project's top level
          directory, relative to which other directories (e.g., the directory
          that contains the Zombies model) are defined. The value of the TURBINE_OUTPUT
          environment variable is also retrieved. This specifies the path to
          a directory where Swift/T stores its log files and which we will use
          as a parent directory for the working directories of our individual runs.
          For more on these variables see the
          <modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/templating.html"
          ref="swift_run_sweep_sh">discussion</modal-data> in the template tutorial.

          On line <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="7" to="7">8</highlight-code>,
          the app function definition begins. The function returns two files, one for standard output and one for standard error.
          The function arguments are those required to run <open-code code="uc1/scripts/repast.sh">repast.sh</open-code>, that is,
          the full path of the script, the parameters to run and the directory where the model run output should be written,
          and the model's input scenario directory.
          The body of the function calls the bash interpreter passing it the name of the script file to execute and the other function
          arguments as well as the project root, that is, <tt id="mycode">emews_root</tt> directory.
          @stdout=out and @stderr=err redirect stdout and stderr to the files out and err.
          It should be easy to see how any model or application that can be run from the command line
          and wrapped in a bash script can be called from Swift in this way.
        </p>

        <h3 id="utility_functions">Utility Functions</h3>
        The script also contains two other app functions. The first <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift"
        color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="12" to="14">make_dir</highlight-code> simply
        calls the Unix mkdir command to create a specified directory. The second
        <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="16" to="19">cp_message_center</highlight-code>
        calls the unix cp command to copy a Repast Simphony logging configuration file into
        the current working directory. Both of these are used by the parameter sweeping part of the script.

        <h2> Parameter Sweeping</h2>
        <p>The remainder of the script performs a simple parameter sweep using the
          <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="7" to="10">repast</highlight-code>
          app function to run the model. The parameters over which we want to sweep are defined in an external file
          where each row of the file contains a parameter set for an individual run. The script will read
          these parameter sets and launch as many parallel runs as possible for a given process configuration,
          passing each run an individual parameter set. The general script flow is as follows:

          <ol id="myol">
            <li>Read the the list of parameters into a <tt id="mycode">file</tt> object.</li>
            <li>Split the contents of the file into lines and store each as an array element.</li>
            <li>Iterate over the array in parallel, launching a model run
              for each parameter set (i.e., array element) in the array, using
              the repast app function.</li>
          </ol>

          Script execution begins in line
          <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="20" to="20">21</highlight-code>,
          by calling the <tt id="mycode">cp_message_center</tt> app function.
          In the absence of any data flow dependency, Swift statements will execute in parallel whenever possible.
          However, in our case, the Repast Simphony logging configuration file must be in place before a Zombie model run begins.
          The <tt id="mycode">=></tt> symbol enforces the required sequential execution:
          the code on its left-hand side must complete execution before the code on the right-hand side begins execution.

          Line <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="21" to="21">22</highlight-code>
          initializes a Swift/T <tt id="mycode">file</tt> variable with the location of the repast.sh script file. Note that the Swift/T <tt id="mycode">input</tt>
          function takes a path and returns a <tt id="mycode">file</tt>. Then in line
          <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
          from="22" to="22">23</highlight-code> the path of the parameter file that contains
          the parameter sets that will be passed as input to the Zombies model is defined, also as a <tt id="mycode">file</tt> variable.
          This line uses
          the swift built-in function <tt id="mycode">argv</tt> to parse command line arguments to the Swift script.
          As indicated earlier, each line of this <tt id="mycode">upf</tt> file contains an individual parameter set, that is,
          the random_seed, zombie_count, human_count, zombie_step_size and human_step_size
          for a single model run. The parameter set is passed as a single string
          (e.g., random_seed = 14344, zombie_count = 10 ...)
          to the Zombies model where it is parsed into the individual parameters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Line <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="23" to="23">24</highlight-code>
          reads the <tt id="mycode">upf</tt> file into an array of strings where each line of the file is an element in the array.
          The built-in Swift <tt id="mycode">file_lines</tt> function (requires import of files module in line
          <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="2" to="2">3</highlight-code>)
          is used to read the upf file into this array of strings.
          The <tt id="mycode">foreach</tt> loop that begins on line
          <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="24" to="24">25</highlight-code>
          executes its loop iterations in parallel. In the <tt id="mycode">foreach</tt> loop, the variable <tt id="mycode">s</tt> is set to an
          array element (that is, a single parameter set represented as a string) while the variable <tt id="mycode">i</tt> is the index of that array element.
          Lines <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="25" to="25">26</highlight-code>
          and <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="26" to="26">27</highlight-code>
          create an instance directory into which each model run will write its output. The make_dir app function
          is used to create the directory. The <tt id="mycode">=></tt> keyword is again used to ensure that the directory is created before the actual model
          run that uses that directory is performed.</p>
          <p>
          Lines <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="27" to="28">28-29</highlight-code>
          create file objects into which the standard out and standard error streams are
          redirected by the <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="7" to="10">repast</highlight-code> function.
          Lastly, in line
          <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="29" to="29">30</highlight-code>,
          the repast app function that performs the Zombie model run is called with the required arguments.</p>

          <p>
          <b>This is a common pattern in EMEWS. Some collection of parameters is parsed into an array in which each element
          is the set of parameters for an individual run. A foreach loop is then
          used to iterate over the array, lauching parallel model runs each with
          their own parameters. In this way the number of model runs that can be
          performed in parallel is limited only by hardware resources.</b>
        </p>

        <h2> Results Analysis </h2>
          <p>
            In our initial script we have seen how to run multiple instances of the Zombies model in parallel, each with a different set of parameters.
            Our next example builds on this by adding some post-run analysis that explores the effect of simulated step size on the final
            number of humans. This analysis will be performed in R and executed within the Swift workflow.

            The new scripts consists of the following steps:

            <ol id="myol">
              <li>Read the the list of a parameters into a <tt id="mycode">file</tt> object.</li>
              <li>Split the contents of the file into an array where each line of
                file is an array element.</li>
              <li>Iterate over the array in parallel, launching a model run
                for each parameter set (i.e. array element) in the array, using
                the repast app function.</li>
              <li>Get the final human count from each run using R, and add it to
                an array.</li>
              <li>Also using R, determine the maximum human
                counts.</li>
              <li>Get the parameters that produced those maximum human
                counts.</li>
              <li>Write those parameters to a file.</li>
            </ol>
          </p><p>

            We present this in two parts. The first describes the changes to the <tt id="mycode">foreach</tt> loop to gather the output and the
            second describes how that output is analyzed to determine the "best" parameter combination.
          </p>

          <h3 id="gather_results"> Gathering the Results </h3>
          <p>
            This example assumes an existing parameter file in which zombie_step_size and human_step_size are varied.
            For each run of the model, that is, for each combination of parameters, the model records a count of
            each agent type at each time step in an output file. As before the script will iterate through the
            file performing as many runs as possible in parallel. However, an additional step that reads each output file and
            determines the parameter combination or combinations that resulted in the most humans surviving at the
            final time step has been added.
          </p><p>
            The updated swift code is in <open-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift">swiftrun_R.swift</open-code>.

            Here the repast call is now followed by the execution of an R script in line
            <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="46" to="46">47</highlight-code>.
            This uses Swift/T's support for the R language. R code can be run using
            Swift's <tt id="mycode">R</tt> function. <tt id="mycode">R</tt> takes two arguments, the R code to run,
            and an additional R statement that generates the desired return value of the R
            code as a string. The return statement is typically something like <tt id="mycode">"toString(res)"</tt>
            where R's <tt id="mycode">toString</tt> function is passed a variable that contains what
            you want to return from the R script. Our R script reads the CSV file produced by a model run into a data frame,
            accesses the last row of that data frame, and then the value of the human_count column in that row is
            assigned to the <tt id="mycode">res</tt> variable.
            This script itself (lines
            <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="6" to="9">7-10</highlight-code>)
            is assigned to the <tt id="mycode">count_humans</tt> string variable. The string contains a template character, "%s",
            (line <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="7" to="7">8</highlight-code>)
            that can be replaced with the actual directory in which the output file (counts.csv) is written.
            Line
            <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="45" to="45">46</highlight-code>
            performs this substitution with the directory for the current run, using the "%" format Swift operator.
            The resulting R code string is evaluated in line
            <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="46" to="46">47</highlight-code>
            using the Swift <tt id="mycode">R</tt> function.
            In this case, the <tt id="mycode">res</tt> variable in the R script (line
            <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="8" to="8">9</highlight-code>)
            contains the number of surviving humans. This string is then placed in the results array at the ith index.
          </p><p>
            <h3 id="finding_best"> Finding the Best Parameters</h3>
            <p>
              The final workflow steps are to determine which runs yielded the maximum
              number of humans and write out the parameters for those runs. The core idea here is
              that we find the indices of the elements in the
              results array that contain the maximum human counts and use those indices
              to retrieve the parameters from the parameters array.</p>
              <p>
                First Swift's <tt id="mycode">string_join</tt> function (requiring importing the
                 <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="3" to="3">string</highlight-code> module)
                is used to join all the elements of the results array (i.e., all the final human counts)
                into a comma separated string
                (line <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="51" to="51">52</highlight-code>).
                We then use
              R to find the indices of the maximum values in the results array
              by substituting the template variable in the R code template
              contained in the string variable <tt id="mycode">find_max</tt>
              (lines <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="11" to="14">12-15</highlight-code>)
              with this comma separated string
              (line <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="52" to="52">53</highlight-code>)
              to create the working R code. The R code is executed in line
              line <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="53" to="53">54</highlight-code>
              using the <tt id="mycode">R</tt> function. The R code returns a comma separated string
              of numbers where each number is the index in the results array that contained
              a maximum value. This string is split into a <tt id="mycode">max_idxs</tt> array using Swift's <tt id="mycode">split</tt>
              function

              The <tt id="mycode">split</tt> function takes two arguments, the string to split and the string
              to split on, and returns an array of strings.

            The foreach loop (lines
            <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="56" to="59">57-60</highlight-code>)
            iterates through <tt id="mycode">max_idxs</tt> array, converts the string representation of the number to an
            integer, retrieves the corresponding parameter string from the <tt id="mycode">upf_lines</tt> array, and
            adds it to the <tt id="mycode">best_params</tt> array.
            Given that the value in <tt id="mycode">results</tt>[i] (from which the max indices are derived) is produced from the parameter combination in
            <tt id="mycode">upf_lines</tt>[i],
            the index of the maximum value or values in the <tt id="mycode">max_idxs</tt> array is the index of the best parameter combination or combinations.
            Note that we subtract one from <tt id="mycode">idx</tt> because R indices start at 1 while Swift's start at 0.
            The final step is to write the best parameters to a file as seen in lines
            <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun_R.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="60" to="61">61-62</highlight-code>,

          <h2>Running the Swift Script</h2>
          <p>
          Swift scripts are typically launched using a shell script. This allows
          you to export useful values as environment variables and to properly
          configure the swift workflow to be run on HPC resources. If you use
          the <modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/templating.html" ref="EMEWS_templates">EMEWS templates</modal-data>
          such a shell script will automatically be created for you. The shell script for running
          our simple workflow can be see in
          <open-code code="uc1/swift/workflow.sh">workflow.sh</open-code>.

          The workflow.sh file assumes the canonical EMEWS directory structure
          (see the EMEWS templates tutorial for more details) where
          a so-called EMEWS project root directory contains other directories
          such as a <tt id="mycode">swift</tt> directory in which your swift scripts are
          located. workflow.sh defines and exports EMEWS_PROJECT_ROOT in line
          <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/workflow.sh" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="12" to="12">13</highlight-code>,
          and you can see EMEWS_PROJECT_ROOT being used in line
          <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/swiftrun.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="4" to="4">5</highlight-code> of swiftrun.swift.
        </p>
        <p>

          workflow.sh takes 1 required argument: an experiment id (e.g., experiment_1).
          The experiment id is used to define a TURBINE_OUTPUT directory
          (line <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/workflow.sh" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="17" to="17">18</highlight-code>)
          into which per workflow output can be written. Swift will also write its own
          log files into this directory as the workflow executes. workflow.sh
          also defines additional environment variables that are required for
          cluster execution such as <tt id="mycode">WALLTIME</tt>, <tt id="mycode">PPN</tt>, <tt id="mycode">MACHINE</tt>
          and so forth. The final line of workflow.sh (line
          <highlight-code code="uc1/swift/workflow.sh" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="66" to="66">67</highlight-code>)
          runs the swift script by
          calling <tt id="mycode">swift-t</tt> with the script as the argument followed by any
          arguments to the swift script itself (i.e. "-f="). The <tt id="mycode">-n</tt> argument
          specifies the total number of processes on which to run. Additional
          help for the arguments to <tt id="mycode">swift-t</tt> can be seen by running
          <tt id="mycode">swift-t -h</tt>. More information on shell script used to
          launch the Swift/T workflow can be seen in the description of the
          <modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/templating.html" ref="swift_run_sweep_sh"><tt id="myfn">swift_run_sweep.sh</tt></modal-data>
          section of the templating tutorial.
