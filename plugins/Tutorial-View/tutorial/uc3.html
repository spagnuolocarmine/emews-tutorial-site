<p>
In this use case, we will show how to integrate a multi-process distributed
native code model written in C++ into a Swift/T workflow. The model is a variant
of the Java Zombies model, written in C++ and using MPI and
<modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/refs/collier_parallel_2012.html">the Repast HPC
toolkit</modal-data> to distribute the model across multiple
processes. The complete two dimensional continuous space and grid span processes
and each individual process holds some subsection of the continuous space and
grid. The Zombies and Humans behave as in the other tutorials but may cross process boundaries
into another subsection of the continuous space and grid as they move about the
complete space. The model itself is driven by an
<modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/refs/settles_active_2012.html">active learning</modal-data>
algorithm using EQ/R.
As was discussed in the <modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/templating.html"
ref="eqr_section">EQ/R section</modal-data>
of the EMEWS Template tutorial, the EQ/R extension provides an interface for
interacting with R-based code run in a resident tasks
at specific locations. The code that we present in this use case is directly
adapted from the EQ/R subtemplate, so readers who have completed the EMEWS
Templates tutorial should already be familiar with the directory structure and
template code.
</p>

<h2>Integrating the distributed MPI-based Model with Swift/T</h2>
<p>
In contrast to the previous two tutorials the MPI-based HPC Zombies model is
compiled as a shared library that exposes a Swift/T Tcl interface
<modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/refs/Swift_2015.html">
(Wozniak et al. 2015)</modal-data>. Swift/T runs on Tcl and thus wrapping the library
in Tcl provides tighter integration than an app function
(e.g. those that call a bash script to run the model as we have seen in
the previous tutorials). Wrapping the library in a Tcl interface is
also necessary for multi-process distributed models that use MPI.
Such models when run as standalone applications initialize an MPI
Communicator of the correct size within which the model can be distributed
and run. Since the HPC Zombies model uses MPI, as do all Repast HPC based
models, it must be treated as an MPI library and passed an MPI communicator
of the correct size when run from
<modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/swiftt.html" ref="parallel_task">
Swift/T</modal-data>.
</p>

The steps for integrating an MPI distributed application, such as HPC Zombies,
 with Swift/T are as follows:
<ol id="myol">
  <li>Modify the application code such that it will work as a
    shared library rather than a standalone application.</li>
  <li>Create a Tcl binding for the function that runs the application.</li>
  <li>Create a Swift/T extension Tcl package from the binding and library code.</li>
  <li>Create swift language bindings for the Tcl function created in step 2, using
    the package created in step 3.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Modifing the Application Code</h3>
<p>
The first step in integrating the HPC Zombies model with Swift/T is to compile
it as library, replacing the standalone application's <tt id="mycode">main()</tt>
function with a function that can run the model with some particular set of parameters.
In the HPC Zombies case, we have defined this new function in
 <open-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/src/run.h"><tt id="myfn">run.h</tt></open-code>
 and
 <open-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/src/run.cpp"><tt id="myfn">run.cpp</tt></open-code>.
 The
 <highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/src/run.h" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
   from="20" to="20"><tt id="mycode">zombies_model_run</tt></highlight-code> function has
   three arguments: the MPI communicator in which the
   model runs, the filename of a Repast HPC config file, and the parameters for
   the current run. The function returns a string that contains the number of
   humans and zombies at each time step.
   The MPI communicator argument is required for all MPI distributed models
   to be integrated with swift while the <tt id="mycode">parameters</tt> will be found
   in any model that receives model run parameters from a swift script. The
   format of that string is, of course, model dependent. When
   this function is called, it starts a model run using these arguments. Note
   that the same function will be a called iteratively on the same process,
   and so there may be some additional initialization and termination
   code required to insure that a current run is not effected by anything
   left over from a previous run.
</p>

<h3>Creating the Tcl Binding</h3>
<p>
The next step is to make this function callable from Tcl via a SWIG created binding.
<modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/refs/Beazley_1996.html">SWIG</modal-data>
is a software tool that generates the 'glue code'
required for some target language, such as Tcl, to call C or C++ code. The SWIG
tool processes an interface file and produces the glue code binding as a
source code file. In this case, the C++ code we want to be able to call from Tcl
is our
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/src/run.h" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="20" to="20"><tt id="mycode">zombies_model_run</tt></highlight-code> function
and thus we need to generate the glue code binding for it.
The interface file is used to specify the C/C++ code that will be bound and
contains SWIG directives and the relevant C/C++ headers. The following
briefly describes the HPC Zombies interface file,
<open-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/zombies_model.i">zombies_model.i</open-code>,
(Using SWIG is well covered elsewhere
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.swig.org">www.swig.org</a>.) The interface file
begins in line
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/zombies_model.i" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
from="0" to="0">1</highlight-code> with the
required SWIG module directive. The include directive in line
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/zombies_model.i" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
from="2" to="2">3</highlight-code> is used to add
the built-in SWIG interface file for C++ strings. This is required because the
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/src/run.h" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="20" to="20"><tt id="mycode">zombies_model_run</tt></highlight-code> function
uses C++ standard library strings. Line
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/zombies_model.i" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
from="3" to="3">4</highlight-code> is
similar, but in this case the function declaration in our
<open-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/src/run.h"><tt id="myfn">run.h</tt></open-code>
header are added to the interface file. SWIG will then produce glue code that
allows that function to be called from Tcl. The code between <tt id="mycode">%{</tt> and
<tt id="mycode">%}</tt> in lines
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/zombies_model.i" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
from="5" to="8">6-9</highlight-code> is added as-is directly to the source code
file that SWIG produces, and is typically
used to add headers or typedefs without which the resulting source code would
not compile. The final line is a SWIG typedef directive that allows it to parse
the
<open-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/src/run.h"><tt id="myfn">run.h</tt></open-code>
file without halting on the MPI_Comm declaration. This interface
file can be easily adapted to any model or scientific application that uses MPI
by changing the name of the library header file.
</p>

<p>
The
<open-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/zombies_model.i">zombies_model.i</open-code>
file is run
through SWIG and the resulting source code is compiled together with the HPC Zombies
model library code, creating a shared library with a <tt id="mycode">zombie_model_run</tt>
function that is callable from Tcl. The HPC Zombies Makefile includes
a target,
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/Makefile.tmplt" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
from="113" to=115>../src/zombies_model_wrapper.cpp</highlight-code> that
automates the creation of the glue code (i.e., the
<tt id="myfn">zombies_model_wrapper.cpp</tt> file) as a Makefile target.
</p>

<h3>Creating the Swift/T extension Tcl package</h3>
<p>
Once the glue code has been generated, we now need to a create Swift/T extension
Tcl package. The Tcl package consists of the compiled shared library,
including the glue code, a <tt id="myfn">pkgIndex.tcl</tt> file, and a
<open-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl"><tt id="myfn">zombies_model.tcl</tt></open-code>
Tcl script. The glue code generated in the previous step exposes the
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/src/run.h" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="20" to="20"><tt id="mycode">zombies_model_run</tt></highlight-code> function in the
shared library as a Tcl function, and the code in
<open-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl"><tt id="myfn">zombies_model.tcl</tt></open-code>
allows that Tcl function to be correctly called from within a swift script.
A Tcl package is defined by its <tt id="myfn">pkgIndex.tcl</tt>file that specifies the libraries
that need to be loaded as part of the package and the Tcl code that is in the
package. Tcl has a built-in function <tt id="mycode">::pkg::create</tt> that can be used to
create a <tt id="myfn">pkgIndex.tcl</tt> given a package name, version, the name of the library
to load, and the Tcl code file name. The HPC Zombies
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/Makefile.tmplt" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
from="106" to=111>zombies_tcl_lib</highlight-code> Makefile target uses some simple
Tcl code,
<open-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/make-package.tcl"><tt id="myfn">make-package.tcl</tt></open-code>
to call this function to create the <tt id="mycode">zombies_model</tt> Tcl package. The
<open-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/make-package.tcl"><tt id="myfn">make-package.tcl</tt></open-code>
script is completely generic, getting its parameters from environment variables
set in the Makefile
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/Makefile.tmplt" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="109" to="111"><tt id="mycode">target</tt></highlight-code>. As such, it can be used for other models / applications
as is.
</p>

<p>
The
<open-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl"><tt id="myfn">zombies_model.tcl</tt></open-code>
script contains two procedures that integrate the generic Tcl package with
Swift/T. The script begins by specifying that this script requires the
Swift/T turbine package and that the two producers are in the <tt id="mycode">zombies_model</tt>
namespace (lines
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl"
color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"from="0" to="2">1-3</highlight-code>). As a
distributed MPI-based application, the HPC Zombies model
must be run as a
<modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/swiftt.html"
ref="parallel_task">parallel task</modal-data>
from within the swift script. For parallel tasks Swift/T currently
requires two Tcl procedures, a dataflow interface that specifies how
the procedure integrates with Swift/T's concurrent dataflow, and a body that calls the
appropriate function in the shared library. The dataflow interface for HPC
Zombies is defined in lines
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="4" to="6">5-7</highlight-code>. Here, the <tt id="mycode">rule</tt> command
  in line
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl"
color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)" from="5" to="5">6</highlight-code> registers
dataflow execution: when all input IDs <tt id="mycode">ins</tt> are available, the body procedure,
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
      from="8" to="20"><tt id="mycode">zombies_model_body</tt></highlight-code>,
will be released to the Swift/T load balancer and executed on
an available subset of workers. The <tt id="mycode">args</tt> argument are Swift-specific task settings,
including the <tt id="mycode">@par</tt> parallel settings, and are not accessed by the user.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, we want the body function to call our
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/src/run.h" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="20" to="20"><tt id="mycode">zombies_model_run</tt></highlight-code> function which we've
  made accessible to Tcl via the SWIG generated glue code. The overall flow
  of the body function then is to:

<ol id="myol">
  <li>Retrieve the configuration file, parameters, and MPI communicator
    arguments.</li>
  <li>Call our <tt id="mycode">zombies_model_run</tt> function, passing it those arguments.</li>
  <li>Retrieve and return the result of the <tt id="mycode">zombies_model_run</tt> function.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The body function begins by retrieving the input parameter
  values from Swift by applying the provided <tt id="mycode">retrieve_string</tt> function
  on the IDs (lines
  <highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
    from="9" to="10"><tt id="mycode">10-11</tt></highlight-code>), obtaining the configuration
file name and the sample model parameters. The
other required arguments is the MPI communicator. Line
  <highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
    from="12" to="12"><tt id="mycode">12</tt></highlight-code> gets the MPI subcommunicator
    for the
<modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/swiftt.html"
ref="parallel_task">parallel task</modal-data>. The communicator <tt id="mycode">comm</tt>
will be of the size specified by the Swift/T <tt id="mycode">@par</tt> annotation. Line
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="13" to="13"><tt id="mycode">14</tt></highlight-code> gets the current MPI rank
  in that communicator using built-in Swift/t functions. Our HPC Zombies library
  function is then called in line
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="15" to="15"><tt id="mycode">16</tt></highlight-code>, and returns a string containing
  the model output that is stored in <tt id="mycode">z_value</tt>. Only one process need
  store the output <tt id="mycode">z</tt> in Swift memory; we use rank 0
  (lines
  <highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
    from="16" to="18"><tt id="mycode">17-19</tt></highlight-code>). (This interface / body
    pattern can easily be adapted for any MPI application, adjusting for
    any differences in the wrapped library function arguments and additional
    input/output parameters.)
</p>

<h3>Creating the Swift/T Binding</h3>
<p>
The final step is to create the Swift bindings to the Swift/T
extension <tt id="mycode">zombies_model</tt> Tcl package created in the
previous step. These Swift bindings define a swift function,
<tt id="mycode">zombies_model_run</tt> that calls the dataflow interface procedure
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="4" to="6">zombies_model</highlight-code>.
The Swift bindings are defined in the
<open-code code="uc3/swift/zombies_model.swift">zombies_model.swift</open-code>
swift script file. The script defines a single function:
<highlight-code code="uc3/swift/zombies_model.swift" from="0" to="0"><tt id="mycode">zombies_model_run</tt></highlight-code>.
The function is annotated with <tt id="mycode">@par</tt>, allowing it to be called as a parallel
function, and with <tt id="mycode">@dispatch=WORKER</tt> directing the function to run on
a worker node. The function itself returns a string that contains the number of
humans and zombies at each time step. For arguments, the function takes the
config file file name and a string containing the parameters for the run. As
we have seen above, the model will ultimately parse the individual parameters
from this <tt id="mycode">params</tt> string. The final 3 parts of the function definition
are the Tcl package name, the required package version, and the Tcl function to
call in the package, namely our dataflow procedure
<highlight-code code="uc3/hpc_zombies/swift/lib/zombies_model.tcl" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="4" to="6">zombies_model</highlight-code>. When this swift script
is imported into a workflow script, we can then run the HPC Zombies model with
a call like:
<p>
<pre>
string output = @par=4 zombies_model_run(config_file, params);
</pre>
</p>

<h2>The Integrated Model Workflow</h2>

<p>
Once the model has been properly integrated with Swift/T we can then
run it as part of a workflow. As mentioned above, this workflow uses
<modal-data data="plugins/Tutorial-View/tutorial/templating.html"
ref="eqpr_section">EQ/R</modal-data> in an inversion of control (IoC) approach
in which an active learning (AL) algorithm written in R controls the model runs.
AL is a general approach that can afford a fair amount of customization in its
specific implementation. The overall process is to iteratively pick points
(individual or sets of parameters) to sample, where the sampled points are chosen
through some query strategy. In our case, we choose an uncertainty sampling
strategy, where we employ a machine learning classifier (Random Forest) on the
already collected data and then choose subsequent samples (sets of
parameters to run) close to the classification boundary, i.e., where the
uncertainty between classes is maximal. To take advantage of the concurrency
that we have available on HPC systems, the samples at each round of the AL
procedure are batch collected (and evaluated) in parallel. In order to decrease
the overlap in reducing classification uncertainty that nearby maximally
uncertain sample points are likely to have, we cluster all the candidate points
and choose an individual point within each cluster.
</p>
<p>
Our active
active learning algorithm classifies a model run into one of two categories
based on the model runs output (i.e the number of humans at each time step)
The two categories
are defined by whether the sum of the squared errors of the output with respect to
some baseline output is less than a specified threshold.
(These are, of course, synthetic categories. A more realistic active learning examample
would use something like disease outcomes as classes (e.g. dead, recovered, immune)
with a disease simulation.) Our algorithm begins with an existing set of parameters
that uniformly cover the parameter space. The inital collection of parameters
for model runs is selected at
random from this existing set while the subsequent parameter collections are a mix of random and those selected
via the clustering. The following is the overall EMEWS workflow structure for this use case.

  Several functions in the default swift code as generated by the template

The
<highlight-code code="uc3/swift/uc3.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="55" to="55">loop</highlight-code> function iteratively
  retrieves sets of model run parameters from <tt id="mycode">algo.R</tt> using
  <tt id="mycode">EQR_get</tt> and runs the HPC Zombies model via the <tt id="mycode">obj</tt>
  function (line

    the swift <tt id="mycode">EQR_get</tt> calls in the <tt id="mycode">loop</tt> function are on lines

      passes the initial set of random parameters selected by the algorithm. The
      second passes the random set and those selected by the clustering. The final
      two pass the <tt id="mycode">"FINAL"</tt> flag and a message about the location
      of the final serialized classifier. Unlike the default <tt id="mycode">eqr</tt> version,
      our <tt id="mycode">obj</tt> function returns strings and joins those with a
      <tt id="mycode">";"</tt> eliminating the need for the second foreach
      loop that is present in the default template created

The <tt id="mycode">loop</tt> function runs the model by calling the
<highlight-code code="uc3/swift/uc3.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="77" to="77"><tt id="mycode">obj</tt></highlight-code> function within a
  parallel <tt id="mycode">foreach</tt> loop, passing each model run a set of parameters.
  The <tt id="mycode">obj</tt> function first creates a complete parameter string
  by combining the dynamic parameters received from the active learning
  algorithm with some "baseline" constant parameters
  (line
  <highlight-code code="uc3/swift/uc3.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
    from="47" to="47"><tt id="mycode">48</tt></highlight-code>)
  that are read from a file (line
  <highlight-code code="uc3/swift/uc3.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
    from="44" to="44"><tt id="mycode">45</tt></highlight-code>). The HPC Zombies
    model requires that all its parameters are passed at run time. The active
    learning algorithm only produces a subset of those. Consequently, the
    active learning produced parameters need to be combined with the remaining
    required parameters.
  This <tt id="mycode">full_parameters</tt> string together with the path to the config file
  is then passed to our <tt id="mycode">zombies_model_run</tt> function (line
  <highlight-code code="uc3/swift/uc3.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
    from="49" to="49"><tt id="mycode">50</tt></highlight-code>), that is,
    function we created in our swift bindings to run the model.
    The <tt id="mycode">zombies_model_run</tt> call is annotated with <tt id="mycode">@par=4</tt>,
    running the function as a parallel task in an MPI communicator of size 4,
    the number required to correctly run the HPC Zombies model. The
    results of the model run are stored in the <tt id="mycode">z</tt> variable. In
    line <highlight-code code="uc3/swift/uc3.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
      from="50" to="50"><tt id="mycode">51</tt></highlight-code> <tt id="mycode">calc_obj</tt> is called.
    <tt id="mycode">calc_obj</tt> is defined in <open-code code="uc3/swift/R_obj.swift">R_obj.swift</open-code>.
    It calculates the sum of squared errors between the model results (<tt id="mycode">z</tt>)
    and the synthetic expected output (<tt id="mycode">str_zombie_data</tt>).
    The function's return value <tt id="mycode">fitness</tt> is set to this sum of squared errors.
    Both the <tt id="mycode">zombies_model_run</tt> and the <tt id="mycode">calc_obj</tt> function are
    included via swift imports on lines
    <highlight-code code="uc3/swift/uc3.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
      from="7" to="7"><tt id="mycode">8</tt></highlight-code> and

      from="8" to="8"><tt id="mycode">9</tt></highlight-code> respectively.
</p>
<p>

The return values of all the parallel calls to <tt id="mycode">obj</tt> are
gathered in the <tt id="mycode">results</tt> array in the loop function, and
then joined into a single string and passed to the R algorithm using
<tt id="mycode">EQR_put</tt> (lines
<highlight-code code="uc3/swift/uc3.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
  from="80" to="81"><tt id="mycode">81-82</tt></highlight-code>).
</p>

<p>
<tt id="myfn">uc3.swift</tt> contains a few other changes from the default not
included in the above description. These are described below.
  <ul>

   <li>Lines
     <highlight-code code="uc3/swift/uc3.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
       from="15" to="20">16-21</highlight-code> define the path to the
       active learning algorithm R file,
       the location of the data directory, the "zombie data" against which
       the sum of squared errors will be calculated, and the path to
       a serialized R data table that contains the pre-existing set of model run parameters
       used by the algorithm.</li>

   <li>Lines
     <highlight-code code="uc3/swift/uc3.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
       from="22" to="24">23-25</highlight-code> retrieve the <tt id="mycode">config</tt>,
       <tt id="mycode">num_clusters</tt>, and <tt id="mycode">num_random_sampling</tt> command line
       arguments to the script. Note that the config file is optional.</li>

   <li>Lines
     <highlight-code code="uc3/swift/uc3.swift" color="rgba(255,255,255,0.3)"
       from="27" to="42">28-43</highlight-code> define the <tt id="mycode">algo_params</tt>
       string that is passed to the R active learing algorithm to
       initialize it.</li>
</ul>
</p>

The substantive changes to the default <tt id="mycode">eqr</tt> were primarily concerned
with running the model, given that the model itself is now a Swift/T
extension. Consequently, all the swift code that concerned with running the
model could be removed and gathering results could be removed. As
an extension the model can be run with a single function that returns
all the output of interest. Any MPI-based distributed application or model
will make similar changes.
