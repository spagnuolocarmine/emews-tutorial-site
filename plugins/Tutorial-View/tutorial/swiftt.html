  The Swift language allows the developer to rapidly implement workflows.
  The Swift/T implementation of Swift focuses on high-performance workflows to
  utilize TOP500 machines.  Such systems are characterized by high
  concurrency (tens of thousands of processor cores or more) and
  low-latency networks.  Swift/T can utilize these systems well,
  producing over a billion tasks per second.  As a
  workflow language, Swift composes existing software components into an
  overall workflow. The following sections describe Swift/T features
  relevant to EMEWS. For more details, see the <a target="_blank" href="http://swift-lang.org/Swift-T">Swift/T website</a>.
</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>

  The Swift language uses C-like syntax and conventional data types such
  as int, float, and string.It also has typical control
  constructs such as if, for, and foreach.  Swift code can
  be encapsulated into functions, which can be called recursively.  As
  shown in <open-code code="swiftt/add.swift"><tt id="myfn">add.swift</tt></open-code>, Swift can perform typical arithmetic and string
  processing tasks quite naturally.  Swift also has a file type,
  that allows dataflow processing on files.
</p>

<h2>Invocation</h2>
<p>
Running Swift/T in the shell is easy: an example of running
<open-code code="swiftt/add.swift"><tt id="myfn">add.swift</tt></open-code>
is shown in
<open-code code="swiftt/add.transcript.sh"><tt id="myfn">add.transcript.sh</tt></open-code>.
</p>

<h3 id="external_execution">External execution</h3>
<p>
  Swift is primarily designed to call into external user code, such as
  simulations or analysis routines implemented in various languages.
  Like many other systems, Swift/T supports calls into the shell.
  However, this is not efficient at large scale, and so Swift/T also
  supports calls into native code libraries directly.
</p><p>
  An example use of Swift for shell tasks is shown in <open-code code="swiftt/compile.swift"><tt id="myfn">compile.swift</tt></open-code>.
  This example demonstrates a fragment of a build system.  The user
  defines two app functions, which compile and link a C language
  file.  Swift app functions differ from other Swift functions in
  that they operate primarily on variables of type file.
</p><p>
  Other forms of external execution in Swift/T allow the user to call
  into native code (C/C++/Fortran) directly by constructing a package
  with SWIG.  Such libraries can be assembled with dynamic or static
  linking; in the static case, the Swift script and the native code
  libraries are bundled into a single executable with minimal
  system dependencies for the most efficient loading on a large-scale
  machine.
</p>

<h2>Concurrency</h2>
<p>


  The key purpose of Swift is to gain concurrency easily and correctly.
  This is accomplished in Swift through the use of <i id="myi">dataflow</i> instead
  of <i id="myi">control flow</i>.  In Swift, there is no instruction pointer,
  execution is triggered wherever possible limited only by data
  availability.  This results in an implicitly parallel programming
  model.  Two modes of concurrency are shown in
  <open-code code="swiftt/concurrency.swift"><tt id="myfn">concurrency.swift</tt></open-code>, both
  based on the ready availability of <tt id="mycode">i</tt>.  Computing the
  ith Fibonacci number relies on two concurrent recursive
  calls, and iteration over an array of known values allows for parallel
  execution.  Ordering can be forced with the
  <tt id="mycode"><i id="myi">statement1</i> => <i id="myi">statement2</i></tt> syntax, which creates an artificial
  data dependency.
</p>
<h2>Support for interpreted languages</h2>
<p>
  Swift/T also provides high-level, easy to use interfaces for
  Python, R, Julia and Tcl, allowing the developer to pass a string of
  code into the language interpreter for execution (via its C or C++
  interface).  These interpreters are optionally linked to the Swift
  runtime when it is built.  This allows the user to tightly integrate
  Swift logic with calls to the interpreters, as the interpreter does
  not have to be launched as a separate program for each call.  This is
  a crucially significant performance benefit on very large scale
  supercomputers, enabling us to make millions of calls to the
  interpreter per second.
</p>
<p>
  <p style="font-weight:bold;">
    Python
  </p>
  <p>
    Many users desire to access Python from the top level of the
    scientific workflow; and optionally call down from the interpreted
    level into native code, to gain high-performance operations for
    numerical methods or event-based simulation.  A popular example of
    this model is Numpy, which provides a high-level interface for
    interaction, with high-performance, vendor-optimized BLAS, LAPACK,
    and/or ATLAS numerical libraries underneath.  (Python, R, Julia and
    Tcl each support calling to native code in some way; Tcl was designed
    for this purpose.)
  </p>
  <p>
    One use of Python from Swift/T is shown in
    <open-code code="swiftt/F.py">F.py</open-code>
    <open-code code="swiftt/python-f.swift">python-f.swift</open-code>.
    In this example, a short module is defined in
    <open-code code="swiftt/F.py">F.py</open-code>
    which provides an
    addition function named f().  A call to this function from Swift/T
    is shown in <open-code code="swiftt/python-f.swift">python-f.swift</open-code> lines
    <highlight-code code="swiftt/python-f.swift" color="rgba(0,0,255,0.3)" from="2" to="3">3-4</highlight-code>.
    The string containing the
    Python code is populated with the Pythonic <tt id="mycode">%</tt> operator, which fills in
    values for <tt id="mycode">x</tt> and <tt id="mycode">y</tt> at the conversion specifiers <tt id="mycode">%i</tt>.  The
    Python function <tt id="mycode">F.f()</tt> receives these values, adds them, and
    returns the result as a string.  Swift/T receives the result in z
    and reports it with the Swift/T builtin trace() function.  Thus, data can
    easily be passed to and from Python with Pythonic conventions; only
    stringification is required.  To execute, the user simply
    sets PYTHONPATH so that the Python interpreter can find
    module F, and runs swift-t.
  </p>
  <p>
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">R</p> <p>
      The R support in Swift/T is similar to the Python support.  An example
      use case is shown in
      <open-code code="swiftt/stats.swift">stats.swift</open-code>.
      This script intends to run a
      collection of simulations in parallel, then send result values to R
      for statistical processing.  The first section (lines
      <highlight-code code="swiftt/stats.swift" color="rgba(0,0,255,0.3)" from="0" to="1">1-2</highlight-code>
      ) simply
      imports requisite Swift packages.  The second section (lines
      <highlight-code code="swiftt/stats.swift" color="rgba(0,0,255,0.3)" from="3" to="7">4-9</highlight-code>
      )
      defines the external simulation program, which is implemented as a
      call to the bash shell random number generator, seeded with the
      simulation number <tt id="mycode">i</tt>.  The output goes to temporary file <tt id="mycode">o</tt>.
      The third section (lines
      <highlight-code code="swiftt/stats.swift" color="rgba(0,0,255,0.3)" from="9" to="14">10-14</highlight-code>
      ) calls the simulation a number of times,
      reading the output number from disk and storing it in the
      array results.  The fourth section (lines
      <highlight-code code="swiftt/stats.swift" color="rgba(0,0,255,0.3)" from="15" to="18">16-19</highlight-code>
      ) computes the mean
      of results via R.  It joins the results into an R vector,
      constructed with the R function <tt id="mycode">c()</tt>, uses the R
      function <tt id="mycode">mean()</tt>, and returns the mean as a string <tt id="mycode">mean</tt> that is
      printed by Swift.
    </p>
    <h3>Features for large-scale computation</h3>
    <p>

      Swift/T has multiple other features to support the needs of workflow
      applications, including support for locations and MPI tasks.  The
      underlying call from Swift to external code (via the shell, a script,
      or native code) is called a leaf function as its execution is
      opaque to Swift.  These features are accessed by
      Swift/T annotations that are applied to the leaf function
      invocation.  A generic annotation takes the form
      <p id="mycode" align="center">
        type result = @key=value f(params);
      </p>

      where the key and value denote the annotation type.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span id="task_locations" />
      <p style="font-weight:bold;">
        Task locations
      </p>

      <p>
        Task locations allow the developer to specify the location of task
        execution in the system.  Locations are optional; Swift/T defaults to
        placing the next task in a location determined by the load balancer.
        Locations can be used to direct computation to part of the system for
        multiple reasons~.  In a data-intensive
        application, tasks can be sent to the location containing the data
        they desire to process.  In a workflow with resident
        tasks}, certain processes retain state from
        task to task, and can be queried by sending a task to that process.
      </p>  <p>
        A location object L in Swift/T is a data structure containing
        an MPI rank R and optionally other location-aware scheduling
        constraint information.  The MPI rank is the target of the location,
        it is simply a rank integer in the overall Swift/T run, representing a
        single process.  The code in   <open-code code="swiftt/loc.swift">loc.swift</open-code> shows the Swift steps for
        looking up a hostname, constructing a location object, and sending
        a task there.
      </p>
    </p>
    <p><p style="font-weight:bold;">
      <span id="parallel_task"></span>
      Parallel tasks</p>


      Swift/T offers the ability to construct workflows containing large
      numbers of MPI tasks that run on variably-sized
      communicators, see code <open-code code="swiftt/par.swift">par.swift</open-code>.
      <p>  These tasks obtain a
        communicator of a programmatically-determined size, specified with the
        <tt id="mycode">@par</tt> annotation, and (optionally) destroy it on completion.
        Swift/T obtains the given number of worker processes and constructs
        these communicators using the <tt id="mycode">MPI_Comm_create_group()</tt> function
        in MPI 3.  Parallel tasks can be configured to run on contiguous
        processes, or on any available processes.  The <tt id="mycode">@par</tt> annotation can
        be combined with other annotations such as <tt id="mycode">@location</tt>.</p>
      </p>
