    What is EMEWS?
</p>
<p style="margin-top:20px;  font-size:17px; text-align: justify;">
    As high-performance computing resources have become increasingly available,
    new modes of computational processing and experimentation have become possible.
     This tutorial presents the Extreme-scale Model Exploration <a href="http://swift-lang.org/Swift-T/">Swift/T</a> (EMEWS)
     framework for combining existing capabilities for model exploration approaches
     (e.g., model calibration, metaheuristics, data assimilation) and simulations
     (or any “black box” application code) with the <a href="http://swift-lang.org/Swift-T/">Swift/T</a>
      parallel scripting
     language to run scientific workflows on a variety of computing resources,
      from desktop to academic clusters to <a href="https://www.top500.org/">Top 500</a> level supercomputers.
      
       We will present a number of use-cases, starting with a simple
       agent-based model parameter sweep, and ending with a complex
        adaptive parameter space exploration workflow coordinating
        ensembles of distributed simulations. The use-cases are published
        on a public repository for interested parties to download and run on their own.
