###TODO 11/17/2016:

- link color blue is hard to see (regular tutorial links: light green, links to other tutorials: yellow, external links: **remain the same, orange**
- create a readme file for creating the various types of links (and other information) that we need for creating content for the website
- investigate 60/40 tutorial to file split (currently 50/50)
- possibly remove the split functionality for the code tabs (doesn't seem to be working)
- (for future, after full working version) investigate more than 2 possibilities for the tutorial/code split, e.g., 50/50, 60/40 and 100/0.

#####Known bugs:

- (low priority) when reloading a page, the workspace explorer doesn't open and go to the file that was loaded
